# Security-system-in-c-
this project will be associate with login panel in c++. we will use the file in c++ to store our password. change our password. and if the password is correct then we will validate the user and enter the safe zone.

In the starting of the program, there are three choices

1: Change the password:- in the section, we will change the password of our program using the file remember any website you change the password for that you are first to ask old password and then ask for new password and confirm the new password and if you old password match with your password in files and your new password and confirm new password is same then your new password is saved into the file where your old password is stored.

2: Go to login panel to see data:- if the password entered by you is correct then you are allowed to go into the secret area where you are having the secret content.

3: Quit the program:- in this program, you use an infinite while loop till the time you press 1 or 2 you again ask for a choice and when you choose the 3rd option your program will be terminated.

For getting this project you should have a great understanding of file and it's working in c++ without file it's very difficult to get this project so if you don't know anything about the file in c++. then go and learn about the file first.
